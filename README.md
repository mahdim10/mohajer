# Migration Tool

A tool to migrate from **Marzban** to **Marzneshin** in three simple steps:

1. [Data Export](./doc/export.md)
2. [Data Import](./doc/import.md)
3. [Subscription Handling](./doc/handler.md)

> **Note:** Our intention is not to disrespect the hard work of anyone. This project is designed for individuals who, for any reason, need to migrate. I appreciate the efforts of both the Marzban and Marzneshin teams and wish them success. 🤝
